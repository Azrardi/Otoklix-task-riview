Automation testing for the sauce labs demo at https://www.saucedemo.com/ using Katalon Studio

Test Case Manual : TestCase.xlsx

Bug found :
1.	System can checkout without any items selected
2.	No one can add to the number of items chosen, only 1 per item
3.	There are no constraints for buyer information, for example the number of characters that can be accommodated, a combination of characters or numbers for names
4.	The icon cart is working when we do testing manually but when we do automation testing, the cart icon is not recorded
